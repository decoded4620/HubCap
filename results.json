many intermediate changes prevented even cherry-picks.\r\n\r\nReplaces gh-1524\r\nFixes [#4143](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4143)\r\n\r\nSuccessfully tested all interactions+slider demos on Chrome/OSX, Chrome/Android 5.x, Mobile Safari/iOS 9 Simulator, successfully tested interactions+slider default demos on BrowserStack on IE9/Win7, IE11/Win 8.1, Edge12/Win 10.\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Do we bundle PEP in the standard build?\r\n- [x] ~~Deal with IE8, pep won\u0027t load here. Do we just not support it? Adding es5-shim helps, but then we run into other (unrelated) issues, apparently demos/bootstrap.js uses document.head, which IE8 doesn\u0027t support. Switching to document.body \u0027works\u0027, but then it gets stuck somewhere else. Haven\u0027t yet been able to figure out where.~~ We won\u0027t support IE8, IE9 and IE10 in 1.13\r\n- [ ] Windows Phone 8.1 on a BrowserStack Nokia Lumia 930 loads, but draggable doesn\u0027t work at all; slider is usable, but the handle doesn\u0027t move while dragging, only updates when stopping. I tried the pep/paint sample on the same \u0027device\u0027 and it works, so PEP itself seems to be okay.\r\n- [ ] PhantomJS 1.x doesn\u0027t have `Function#bind`, which is annoying, but easy enough to work around. It also doesn\u0027t have MutationObservers, which is a bigger issue (`PointerEventsPolyfill: MutationObservers not found, touch-action will not be dynamically detected`). PhantomJS 2.x is still not usable; [this seems to be the best issue to follow](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12948).\r\n- [x] ~~Running tests/unit/all.html on Chrome/OSX has failures on dialog and draggable, but both also happen on master. Datepicker and effects tests also had failures on master, but those were easy to fix.~~ Fix for draggable is in #1618, can\u0027t reproduce dialog issue anymore.\r\n- [ ] Interactions+slider pass on Chrome/OSX and Chrome/Android 5.x. On Mobile Safari/iOS Simulator, draggable has lots of failures, and gets stuck on \u0027connectToSortable, dragging clone into sortable\u0027 test. Droppable has 2 failures. Sortable has lots of failures. Slider has some failures, one due to a missing pointermove event (slider\u0027s slide event isn\u0027t triggered by `.simulate( \u0027drag\u0027, { dx: 10, dy: 10 } )` call. Part of this is due to `window.scrollTo` behaving differently on iOS, see below.","created_at":"Sep 30, 2015 10:22:07 AM","updated_at":"Jan 26, 2016 6:26:11 AM","merge_commit_sha":"95326dfd644aa0de0075b70d321f65b5fa4b736f","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1611/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/statuses/cc8e8bde8442ac4ac9899ccbecda165c955f6b2f","merged":false,"mergeable":false,"mergeable_state":"dirty","comments":21,"review_comments":0,"commits":2,"additions":1416,"deletions":22,"changed_files":10,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1611"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1611"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1611"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1611/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1611/comments"}}},"user":{"id":52585,"login":"jzaefferer","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzaefferer"}},{"id":46203082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606","state":"open","number":1606,"locked":false,"title":"Menu: Check that there is an active item in _activate function","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606","id":46203082,"html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606","diff_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1606","number":1606,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Menu: Check that there is an active item in _activate function","user":{"id":4718759,"login":"RandScullard","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandScullard"},"body":"If there was no active item, _activate was throwing an exception.","created_at":"Sep 28, 2015 1:20:43 PM","updated_at":"Sep 30, 2015 7:21:18 AM","merge_commit_sha":"9534becf881878c8115171c75df26c012bee855a","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/statuses/9f5ed8a2eba7bb6ee275a35011369fa41b437053","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"clean","comments":9,"review_comments":0,"commits":1,"additions":1,"deletions":1,"changed_files":1,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1606"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1606/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606/comments"}}},"user":{"id":4718759,"login":"RandScullard","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandScullard"}},{"id":41958192,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1585","state":"open","number":1585,"locked":false,"title":"Sortable: Fix position detection if browser\u0027s window is scrolled","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1585","id":41958192,"html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1585","diff_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1585.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1585.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1585","number":1585,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Sortable: Fix position detection if browser\u0027s window is scrolled","user":{"id":2259370,"login":"Tomas-M","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tomas-M"},"body":"If the browsers window is scrolled, and some element is dragged between several connected containers, it had a problem in detection where to insert the placeholder.

Do we just not support it? Adding es5-shim helps, but then we run into other (unrelated) issues, apparently demos/bootstrap.js uses document.head, which IE8 doesn\u0027t support. Switching to document.body \u0027works\u0027, but then it gets stuck somewhere else. Haven\u0027t yet been able to figure out where.~~ We won\u0027t support IE8, IE9 and IE10 in 1.13\r\n- [ ] Windows Phone 8.1 on a BrowserStack Nokia Lumia 930 loads, but draggable doesn\u0027t work at all; slider is usable, but the handle doesn\u0027t move while dragging, only updates when stopping. I tried the pep/paint sample on the same \u0027device\u0027 and it works, so PEP itself seems to be okay.\r\n- [ ] PhantomJS 1.x doesn\u0027t have `Function#bind`, which is annoying, but easy enough to work around. It also doesn\u0027t have MutationObservers, which is a bigger issue (`PointerEventsPolyfill: MutationObservers not found, touch-action will not be dynamically detected`). PhantomJS 2.x is still not usable; [this seems to be the best issue to follow](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12948).\r\n- [x] ~~Running tests/unit/all.html on Chrome/OSX has failures on dialog and draggable, but both also happen on master. Datepicker and effects tests also had failures on master, but those were easy to fix.~~ Fix for draggable is in #1618, can\u0027t reproduce dialog issue anymore.\r\n- [ ] Interactions+slider pass on Chrome/OSX and Chrome/Android 5.x. On Mobile Safari/iOS Simulator, draggable has lots of failures, and gets stuck on \u0027connectToSortable, dragging clone into sortable\u0027 test. Droppable has 2 failures. Sortable has lots of failures. Slider has some failures, one due to a missing pointermove event (slider\u0027s slide event isn\u0027t triggered by `.simulate( \u0027drag\u0027, { dx: 10, dy: 10 } )` call. Part of this is due to `window.scrollTo` behaving differently on iOS, see below.","created_at":"Sep 30, 2015 10:22:07 AM","updated_at":"Jan 26, 2016 6:26:11 AM","merge_commit_sha":"95326dfd644aa0de0075b70d321f65b5fa4b736f","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1611/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/statuses/cc8e8bde8442ac4ac9899ccbecda165c955f6b2f","merged":false,"mergeable":false,"mergeable_state":"dirty","comments":21,"review_comments":0,"commits":2,"additions":1416,"deletions":22,"changed_files":10,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1611"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1611"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1611"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1611/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1611/comments"}}},"user":{"id":52585,"login":"jzaefferer","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzaefferer"}},{"id":46203082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606","state":"open","number":1606,"locked":false,"title":"Menu: Check that there is an active item in _activate function","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606","id":46203082,"html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606","diff_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1606","number":1606,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Menu: Check that there is an active item in _activate function","user":{"id":4718759,"login":"RandScullard","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandScullard"},"body":"If there was no active item, _activate was throwing an exception.","created_at":"Sep 28, 2015 1:20:43 PM","updated_at":"Sep 30, 2015 7:21:18 AM","merge_commit_sha":"9534becf881878c8115171c75df26c012bee855a","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/statuses/9f5ed8a2eba7bb6ee275a35011369fa41b437053","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"clean","comments":9,"review_comments":0,"commits":1,"additions":1,"deletions":1,"changed_files":1,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1606"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1606/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606/comments"}}},"user":{"id":4718759,"login":"RandScullard","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandScullard"}},{"id":41958192,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1585","state":"open","number":1585,"locked":false,"title":"Sortable: Fix position detection if browser\u0027s window is scrolled","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1585","id":41958192,"html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1585","diff_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1585.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1585.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1585","number":1585,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Sortable: Fix position detection if browser\u0027s window is scrolled","user":{"id":2259370,"login":"Tomas-M","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tomas-M"},"body":"If the browsers window is scrolled, and some element is dragged between several connected containers, it had a problem in detection where to insert the placeholder.

many intermediate changes prevented even cherry-picks.\r\n\r\nReplaces gh-1524\r\nFixes [#4143](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4143)\r\n\r\nSuccessfully tested all interactions+slider demos on Chrome/OSX, Chrome/Android 5.x, Mobile Safari/iOS 9 Simulator, successfully tested interactions+slider default demos on BrowserStack on IE9/Win7, IE11/Win 8.1, Edge12/Win 10.\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Do we bundle PEP in the standard build?\r\n- [x] ~~Deal with IE8, pep won\u0027t load here. Do we just not support it? Adding es5-shim helps, but then we run into other (unrelated) issues, apparently demos/bootstrap.js uses document.head, which IE8 doesn\u0027t support. Switching to document.body \u0027works\u0027, but then it gets stuck somewhere else. Haven\u0027t yet been able to figure out where.~~ We won\u0027t support IE8, IE9 and IE10 in 1.13\r\n- [ ] Windows Phone 8.1 on a BrowserStack Nokia Lumia 930 loads, but draggable doesn\u0027t work at all; slider is usable, but the handle doesn\u0027t move while dragging, only updates when stopping. I tried the pep/paint sample on the same \u0027device\u0027 and it works, so PEP itself seems to be okay.\r\n- [ ] PhantomJS 1.x doesn\u0027t have `Function#bind`, which is annoying, but easy enough to work around. It also doesn\u0027t have MutationObservers, which is a bigger issue (`PointerEventsPolyfill: MutationObservers not found, touch-action will not be dynamically detected`). PhantomJS 2.x is still not usable; [this seems to be the best issue to follow](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12948).\r\n- [x] ~~Running tests/unit/all.html on Chrome/OSX has failures on dialog and draggable, but both also happen on master. Datepicker and effects tests also had failures on master, but those were easy to fix.~~ Fix for draggable is in #1618, can\u0027t reproduce dialog issue anymore.\r\n- [ ] Interactions+slider pass on Chrome/OSX and Chrome/Android 5.x. On Mobile Safari/iOS Simulator, draggable has lots of failures, and gets stuck on \u0027connectToSortable, dragging clone into sortable\u0027 test. Droppable has 2 failures. Sortable has lots of failures. Slider has some failures, one due to a missing pointermove event (slider\u0027s slide event isn\u0027t triggered by `.simulate( \u0027drag\u0027, { dx: 10, dy: 10 } )` call. Part of this is due to `window.scrollTo` behaving differently on iOS, see below.","created_at":"Sep 30, 2015 10:22:07 AM","updated_at":"Jan 26, 2016 6:26:11 AM","merge_commit_sha":"95326dfd644aa0de0075b70d321f65b5fa4b736f","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1611/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/statuses/cc8e8bde8442ac4ac9899ccbecda165c955f6b2f","merged":false,"mergeable":false,"mergeable_state":"dirty","comments":21,"review_comments":0,"commits":2,"additions":1416,"deletions":22,"changed_files":10,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1611"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1611"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1611"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1611/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1611/comments"}}},"user":{"id":52585,"login":"jzaefferer","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzaefferer"}},{"id":46203082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606","state":"open","number":1606,"locked":false,"title":"Menu: Check that there is an active item in _activate function","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606","id":46203082,"html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606","diff_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1606","number":1606,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Menu: Check that there is an active item in _activate function","user":{"id":4718759,"login":"RandScullard","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandScullard"},"body":"If there was no active item, _activate was throwing an exception.","created_at":"Sep 28, 2015 1:20:43 PM","updated_at":"Sep 30, 2015 7:21:18 AM","merge_commit_sha":"9534becf881878c8115171c75df26c012bee855a","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/statuses/9f5ed8a2eba7bb6ee275a35011369fa41b437053","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"clean","comments":9,"review_comments":0,"commits":1,"additions":1,"deletions":1,"changed_files":1,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1606"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1606/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606/comments"}}},"user":{"id":4718759,"login":"RandScullard","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandScullard"}},{"id":41958192,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1585","state":"open","number":1585,"locked":false,"title":"Sortable: Fix position detection if browser\u0027s window is scrolled","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1585","id":41958192,"html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1585","diff_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1585.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1585.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1585","number":1585,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Sortable: Fix position detection if browser\u0027s window is scrolled","user":{"id":2259370,"login":"Tomas-M","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tomas-M"},"body":"If the browsers window is scrolled, and some element is dragged between several connected containers, it had a problem in detection where to insert the placeholder.

many intermediate changes prevented even cherry-picks.\r\n\r\nReplaces gh-1524\r\nFixes [#4143](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4143)\r\n\r\nSuccessfully tested all interactions+slider demos on Chrome/OSX, Chrome/Android 5.x, Mobile Safari/iOS 9 Simulator, successfully tested interactions+slider default demos on BrowserStack on IE9/Win7, IE11/Win 8.1, Edge12/Win 10.\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Do we bundle PEP in the standard build?\r\n- [x] ~~Deal with IE8, pep won\u0027t load here. Do we just not support it? Adding es5-shim helps, but then we run into other (unrelated) issues, apparently demos/bootstrap.js uses document.head, which IE8 doesn\u0027t support. Switching to document.body \u0027works\u0027, but then it gets stuck somewhere else. Haven\u0027t yet been able to figure out where.~~ We won\u0027t support IE8, IE9 and IE10 in 1.13\r\n- [ ] Windows Phone 8.1 on a BrowserStack Nokia Lumia 930 loads, but draggable doesn\u0027t work at all; slider is usable, but the handle doesn\u0027t move while dragging, only updates when stopping. I tried the pep/paint sample on the same \u0027device\u0027 and it works, so PEP itself seems to be okay.\r\n- [ ] PhantomJS 1.x doesn\u0027t have `Function#bind`, which is annoying, but easy enough to work around. It also doesn\u0027t have MutationObservers, which is a bigger issue (`PointerEventsPolyfill: MutationObservers not found, touch-action will not be dynamically detected`). PhantomJS 2.x is still not usable; [this seems to be the best issue to follow](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12948).\r\n- [x] ~~Running tests/unit/all.html on Chrome/OSX has failures on dialog and draggable, but both also happen on master. Datepicker and effects tests also had failures on master, but those were easy to fix.~~ Fix for draggable is in #1618, can\u0027t reproduce dialog issue anymore.\r\n- [ ] Interactions+slider pass on Chrome/OSX and Chrome/Android 5.x. On Mobile Safari/iOS Simulator, draggable has lots of failures, and gets stuck on \u0027connectToSortable, dragging clone into sortable\u0027 test. Droppable has 2 failures. Sortable has lots of failures. Slider has some failures, one due to a missing pointermove event (slider\u0027s slide event isn\u0027t triggered by `.simulate( \u0027drag\u0027, { dx: 10, dy: 10 } )` call. Part of this is due to `window.scrollTo` behaving differently on iOS, see below.","created_at":"Sep 30, 2015 10:22:07 AM","updated_at":"Jan 26, 2016 6:26:11 AM","merge_commit_sha":"95326dfd644aa0de0075b70d321f65b5fa4b736f","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1611/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/statuses/cc8e8bde8442ac4ac9899ccbecda165c955f6b2f","merged":false,"mergeable":false,"mergeable_state":"dirty","comments":21,"review_comments":0,"commits":2,"additions":1416,"deletions":22,"changed_files":10,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1611"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1611"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1611"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1611/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1611/comments"}}},"user":{"id":52585,"login":"jzaefferer","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzaefferer"}},{"id":46203082,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606","state":"open","number":1606,"locked":false,"title":"Menu: Check that there is an active item in _activate function","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606","id":46203082,"html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606","diff_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1606","number":1606,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Menu: Check that there is an active item in _activate function","user":{"id":4718759,"login":"RandScullard","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandScullard"},"body":"If there was no active item, _activate was throwing an exception.","created_at":"Sep 28, 2015 1:20:43 PM","updated_at":"Sep 30, 2015 7:21:18 AM","merge_commit_sha":"9534becf881878c8115171c75df26c012bee855a","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/statuses/9f5ed8a2eba7bb6ee275a35011369fa41b437053","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"clean","comments":9,"review_comments":0,"commits":1,"additions":1,"deletions":1,"changed_files":1,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1606"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1606"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1606/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1606/comments"}}},"user":{"id":4718759,"login":"RandScullard","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RandScullard"}},{"id":41958192,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1585","state":"open","number":1585,"locked":false,"title":"Sortable: Fix position detection if browser\u0027s window is scrolled","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/pulls/1585","id":41958192,"html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1585","diff_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1585.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1585.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/issues/1585","number":1585,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Sortable: Fix position detection if browser\u0027s window is scrolled","user":{"id":2259370,"login":"Tomas-M","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tomas-M"},"body":"If the browsers window is scrolled, and some element is dragged between several connected containers, it had a problem in detection where to insert the placeholder.

Ex:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027myToggle.toggle();\u0027\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\r\n\u003cp ng-show\u003d\u0027myToggle.isOpened()\u0027\u003eThe toggle is active\u003c/p\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nso it can be accessed from enclosing components. \r\nUntil this point, it is a kind of custom `controllerAs` property for parent scope.\r\n\r\n### Using with parent components\r\nIn addition, as following the recommendation did by @petebacondarwin in https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/10007#issuecomment-168425866 it is able to assign it to any value, event enclosing controller. Ex:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027$ctrl.myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Keep track of DOM elements\r\nIt also serves to look for exact DOM elements instead of relaying in _jqLite_ searches. In case that there is no a controller, the as directive assigns the current DOM element to the expression set.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cbr\u003eFrom \u003ca href\u003d\u0027https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio\u0027\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\t\u003cplayer\u003e\u003c/player\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027player\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\ttemplate: \u0027\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u003caudio as\u003d\u0027$ctrl.audio\u0027 src\u003d\u0027http://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/2926/\u003dAudioTest_(1).ogg\u0027\u003e\u003c/audio\u003e\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027$ctrl.play()\u0027\u003ePlay\u003c/button\u003e\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u0027,\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.play \u003d function() {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.audio.play();\r\n\t\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### _Deprecating_ ngController\r\nngController is great for SEO webpages, but it has the inconvenience that it does not integrates well with bindings and many things have to be done \u0027manually\u0027. For example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular\r\n\t\t\t.module(\u0027demo\u0027, [])\r\n\t\t\t.service(\u0027booksService\u0027, function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.getBook \u003d function(id) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\treturn { name: \u0027name\u0027+id, abstract: \u0027abstract...\u0027+id };\r\n\t\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\n\t\u003cdiv ng-controller\u003d\u0027BookDetailController as bookDetailCtrl\u0027 book-id\u003d\u00271\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).controller(\u0027BookDetailController\u0027, function(booksService,$attrs) {\r\n\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook($attrs.bookId);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example it needs to access to `$attrs` manually to find the bookId. You can imagine more complex functionalities, but I think that this is just enough to expose.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine that we do a directive to handle the same behaviour:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-detail book-id\u003d\u00272\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-detail\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).directive(\u0027staticBookDetail\u0027, function() {\r\n\t\t\treturn {\r\n\t\t\t\tscope: true,\r\n\t\t\t\tcontroller: function(booksService) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\tcontrollerAs: \u0027bookDetailCtrl\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t\tbindToController: {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbookId: \u0027@\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook($attrs.bookId);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt has a conceptual problem: you must know by heart that static-book-detail publishes the `bookDetailCtrl`. \r\n\r\nAlternatively you can use a component, which always use `$ctrl` like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cp\u003eDoes not works as expected:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-component book-id\u003d\u00273\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{$ctrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{$ctrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-component\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027staticBookComponent\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function(booksService) {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tbindings: {\r\n\t\t\t\tbookId: \u0027@\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this naive solution does not works because `$ctrl` is not defined in the same scope that code relies.\r\n\r\nFinally, using as you can have this solution that seems cleaner and more easy to understand:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cp\u003eIt dows works (and no implicit):\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-component as\u003d\u0027$ctrl\u0027 book-id\u003d\u00274\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{$ctrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{$ctrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-component\u003e\r\n\r\n\t\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n\t\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027myToggle.toggle();\u0027\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\r\n\t\u003cp ng-show\u003d\u0027myToggle.isOpened()\u0027\u003eThe toggle is active\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027toggle\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tvar opened \u003d false;\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.isOpened \u003d function() {Â return opened; };\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.toggle \u003d function() { opened \u003d !opened; };\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Additional Notes_: `as` directive behaviour is very close to **Angular2** `#` template variables. It also copies concepts from _RiotJS_ and _Polymer_ (at least first versions).\r\n","created_at":"Feb 18, 2016 9:57:16 AM","updated_at":"Feb 19, 2016 2:19:17 PM","merge_commit_sha":"45aac1aaee1a94151d6c735b6001933bd751ba49","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/statuses/e8bf84649abde311f00964753ed44bb9cb0058a3","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"clean","comments":4,"review_comments":17,"commits":4,"additions":161,"deletions":0,"changed_files":4,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14080"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14080"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14080/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080/comments"}}},"user":{"id":2758345,"login":"drpicox","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drpicox"}},{"id":59693678,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071","state":"open","number":14071,"locked":false,"title":"perf($animate): listen for document visibility changes","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071","id":59693678,"html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071","diff_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071","number":14071,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"perf($animate): listen for document visibility changes","user":{"id":1153097,"login":"Narretz","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narretz"},"body":"Accessing the document for the hidden state is costly for\r\nplatforms like Electron.\r\n\r\nCloses #14066","created_at":"Feb 17, 2016 11:16:25 AM","updated_at":"Feb 21, 2016 9:44:58 AM","merge_commit_sha":"84df25366d620e8bfc7f5551d33f64586164dd0a","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/statuses/3b4cddad751b7e1e9395ac63c24c5099bf19449a","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"unstable","comments":5,"review_comments":5,"commits":1,"additions":34,"deletions":21,"changed_files":6,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071/comments"}}},"user":{"id":1153097,"login":"Narretz","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narretz"}},{"id":59663844,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14070","state":"open","number":14070,"locked":false,"title":"fix($compile): handle boolean attributes in `@` bindings","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14070","id":59663844,"html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070","diff_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14070","number":14070,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"fix($compile): handle boolean attributes in `@` bindings","user":{"id":232606,"login":"jannic","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jannic"},"body":"Commit db5e0ff handles initial values of boolean attributes.

https://github.com/angular/material/commit/9a36112c2a2604dbfd2100deb2daa661a773ef06 I got problems with scrolling in a virtual-repeat container.\r\n\r\nWhen you use the mousewheel to scroll down the virtual-repeat container, you can scroll lower than possible. The patch https://github.com/angular/material/commit/9a36112c2a2604dbfd2100deb2daa661a773ef06 catches the case that the user scroll lower than bottom and exit the function.\r\n\r\nWith my patch the behaviour is that when the user scrolls lower than the bottom, than the container do scroll to the end of the container.","created_at":"Feb 18, 2016 12:53:49 AM","updated_at":"Feb 26, 2016 4:33:32

Ex:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027myToggle.toggle();\u0027\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\r\n\u003cp ng-show\u003d\u0027myToggle.isOpened()\u0027\u003eThe toggle is active\u003c/p\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nso it can be accessed from enclosing components. \r\nUntil this point, it is a kind of custom `controllerAs` property for parent scope.\r\n\r\n### Using with parent components\r\nIn addition, as following the recommendation did by @petebacondarwin in https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/10007#issuecomment-168425866 it is able to assign it to any value, event enclosing controller. Ex:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027$ctrl.myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Keep track of DOM elements\r\nIt also serves to look for exact DOM elements instead of relaying in _jqLite_ searches. In case that there is no a controller, the as directive assigns the current DOM element to the expression set.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cbr\u003eFrom \u003ca href\u003d\u0027https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio\u0027\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\t\u003cplayer\u003e\u003c/player\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027player\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\ttemplate: \u0027\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u003caudio as\u003d\u0027$ctrl.audio\u0027 src\u003d\u0027http://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/2926/\u003dAudioTest_(1).ogg\u0027\u003e\u003c/audio\u003e\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027$ctrl.play()\u0027\u003ePlay\u003c/button\u003e\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u0027,\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.play \u003d function() {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.audio.play();\r\n\t\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### _Deprecating_ ngController\r\nngController is great for SEO webpages, but it has the inconvenience that it does not integrates well with bindings and many things have to be done \u0027manually\u0027. For example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular\r\n\t\t\t.module(\u0027demo\u0027, [])\r\n\t\t\t.service(\u0027booksService\u0027, function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.getBook \u003d function(id) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\treturn { name: \u0027name\u0027+id, abstract: \u0027abstract...\u0027+id };\r\n\t\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\n\t\u003cdiv ng-controller\u003d\u0027BookDetailController as bookDetailCtrl\u0027 book-id\u003d\u00271\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).controller(\u0027BookDetailController\u0027, function(booksService,$attrs) {\r\n\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook($attrs.bookId);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example it needs to access to `$attrs` manually to find the bookId. You can imagine more complex functionalities, but I think that this is just enough to expose.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine that we do a directive to handle the same behaviour:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-detail book-id\u003d\u00272\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-detail\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).directive(\u0027staticBookDetail\u0027, function() {\r\n\t\t\treturn {\r\n\t\t\t\tscope: true,\r\n\t\t\t\tcontroller: function(booksService) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\tcontrollerAs: \u0027bookDetailCtrl\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t\tbindToController: {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbookId: \u0027@\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook($attrs.bookId);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt has a conceptual problem: you must know by heart that static-book-detail publishes the `bookDetailCtrl`. \r\n\r\nAlternatively you can use a component, which always use `$ctrl` like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cp\u003eDoes not works as expected:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-component book-id\u003d\u00273\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{$ctrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{$ctrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-component\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027staticBookComponent\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function(booksService) {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tbindings: {\r\n\t\t\t\tbookId: \u0027@\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this naive solution does not works because `$ctrl` is not defined in the same scope that code relies.\r\n\r\nFinally, using as you can have this solution that seems cleaner and more easy to understand:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cp\u003eIt dows works (and no implicit):\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-component as\u003d\u0027$ctrl\u0027 book-id\u003d\u00274\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{$ctrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{$ctrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-component\u003e\r\n\r\n\t\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n\t\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027myToggle.toggle();\u0027\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\r\n\t\u003cp ng-show\u003d\u0027myToggle.isOpened()\u0027\u003eThe toggle is active\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027toggle\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tvar opened \u003d false;\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.isOpened \u003d function() {Â return opened; };\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.toggle \u003d function() { opened \u003d !opened; };\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Additional Notes_: `as` directive behaviour is very close to **Angular2** `#` template variables. It also copies concepts from _RiotJS_ and _Polymer_ (at least first versions).\r\n","created_at":"Feb 18, 2016 9:57:16 AM","updated_at":"Feb 19, 2016 2:19:17 PM","merge_commit_sha":"45aac1aaee1a94151d6c735b6001933bd751ba49","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/statuses/e8bf84649abde311f00964753ed44bb9cb0058a3","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"clean","comments":4,"review_comments":17,"commits":4,"additions":161,"deletions":0,"changed_files":4,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14080"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14080"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14080/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080/comments"}}},"user":{"id":2758345,"login":"drpicox","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drpicox"}},{"id":59693678,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071","state":"open","number":14071,"locked":false,"title":"perf($animate): listen for document visibility changes","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071","id":59693678,"html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071","diff_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071","number":14071,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"perf($animate): listen for document visibility changes","user":{"id":1153097,"login":"Narretz","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narretz"},"body":"Accessing the document for the hidden state is costly for\r\nplatforms like Electron.\r\n\r\nCloses #14066","created_at":"Feb 17, 2016 11:16:25 AM","updated_at":"Feb 21, 2016 9:44:58 AM","merge_commit_sha":"84df25366d620e8bfc7f5551d33f64586164dd0a","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/statuses/3b4cddad751b7e1e9395ac63c24c5099bf19449a","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"unstable","comments":5,"review_comments":5,"commits":1,"additions":34,"deletions":21,"changed_files":6,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071/comments"}}},"user":{"id":1153097,"login":"Narretz","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narretz"}},{"id":59663844,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14070","state":"open","number":14070,"locked":false,"title":"fix($compile): handle boolean attributes in `@` bindings","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14070","id":59663844,"html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070","diff_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14070","number":14070,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"fix($compile): handle boolean attributes in `@` bindings","user":{"id":232606,"login":"jannic","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jannic"},"body":"Commit db5e0ff handles initial values of boolean attributes.

When the checkbox is unselected these cached searches will be used and therefore, selected contacts will still not appear even though they are not being filtered out. Even though this is unintuitive I thought it wasn\u0027t a big problem as it is very unlikely the `filter-selected` setting will be changed while the directive is in use.\r\n\r\nCloses

Ex:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027myToggle.toggle();\u0027\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\r\n\u003cp ng-show\u003d\u0027myToggle.isOpened()\u0027\u003eThe toggle is active\u003c/p\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nso it can be accessed from enclosing components. \r\nUntil this point, it is a kind of custom `controllerAs` property for parent scope.\r\n\r\n### Using with parent components\r\nIn addition, as following the recommendation did by @petebacondarwin in https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/10007#issuecomment-168425866 it is able to assign it to any value, event enclosing controller. Ex:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027$ctrl.myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Keep track of DOM elements\r\nIt also serves to look for exact DOM elements instead of relaying in _jqLite_ searches. In case that there is no a controller, the as directive assigns the current DOM element to the expression set.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cbr\u003eFrom \u003ca href\u003d\u0027https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio\u0027\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\t\u003cplayer\u003e\u003c/player\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027player\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\ttemplate: \u0027\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u003caudio as\u003d\u0027$ctrl.audio\u0027 src\u003d\u0027http://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/2926/\u003dAudioTest_(1).ogg\u0027\u003e\u003c/audio\u003e\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027$ctrl.play()\u0027\u003ePlay\u003c/button\u003e\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u0027,\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.play \u003d function() {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.audio.play();\r\n\t\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### _Deprecating_ ngController\r\nngController is great for SEO webpages, but it has the inconvenience that it does not integrates well with bindings and many things have to be done \u0027manually\u0027. For example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular\r\n\t\t\t.module(\u0027demo\u0027, [])\r\n\t\t\t.service(\u0027booksService\u0027, function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.getBook \u003d function(id) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\treturn { name: \u0027name\u0027+id, abstract: \u0027abstract...\u0027+id };\r\n\t\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\n\t\u003cdiv ng-controller\u003d\u0027BookDetailController as bookDetailCtrl\u0027 book-id\u003d\u00271\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).controller(\u0027BookDetailController\u0027, function(booksService,$attrs) {\r\n\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook($attrs.bookId);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example it needs to access to `$attrs` manually to find the bookId. You can imagine more complex functionalities, but I think that this is just enough to expose.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine that we do a directive to handle the same behaviour:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-detail book-id\u003d\u00272\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-detail\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).directive(\u0027staticBookDetail\u0027, function() {\r\n\t\t\treturn {\r\n\t\t\t\tscope: true,\r\n\t\t\t\tcontroller: function(booksService) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\tcontrollerAs: \u0027bookDetailCtrl\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t\tbindToController: {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbookId: \u0027@\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook($attrs.bookId);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt has a conceptual problem: you must know by heart that static-book-detail publishes the `bookDetailCtrl`. \r\n\r\nAlternatively you can use a component, which always use `$ctrl` like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cp\u003eDoes not works as expected:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-component book-id\u003d\u00273\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{$ctrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{$ctrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-component\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027staticBookComponent\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function(booksService) {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tbindings: {\r\n\t\t\t\tbookId: \u0027@\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this naive solution does not works because `$ctrl` is not defined in the same scope that code relies.\r\n\r\nFinally, using as you can have this solution that seems cleaner and more easy to understand:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cp\u003eIt dows works (and no implicit):\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-component as\u003d\u0027$ctrl\u0027 book-id\u003d\u00274\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{$ctrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{$ctrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-component\u003e\r\n\r\n\t\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n\t\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027myToggle.toggle();\u0027\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\r\n\t\u003cp ng-show\u003d\u0027myToggle.isOpened()\u0027\u003eThe toggle is active\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027toggle\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tvar opened \u003d false;\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.isOpened \u003d function() {Â return opened; };\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.toggle \u003d function() { opened \u003d !opened; };\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Additional Notes_: `as` directive behaviour is very close to **Angular2** `#` template variables. It also copies concepts from _RiotJS_ and _Polymer_ (at least first versions).\r\n","created_at":"Feb 18, 2016 9:57:16 AM","updated_at":"Feb 19, 2016 2:19:17 PM","merge_commit_sha":"45aac1aaee1a94151d6c735b6001933bd751ba49","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/statuses/e8bf84649abde311f00964753ed44bb9cb0058a3","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"clean","comments":4,"review_comments":17,"commits":4,"additions":161,"deletions":0,"changed_files":4,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14080"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14080"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14080/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080/comments"}}},"user":{"id":2758345,"login":"drpicox","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drpicox"}},{"id":59693678,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071","state":"open","number":14071,"locked":false,"title":"perf($animate): listen for document visibility changes","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071","id":59693678,"html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071","diff_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071","number":14071,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"perf($animate): listen for document visibility changes","user":{"id":1153097,"login":"Narretz","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narretz"},"body":"Accessing the document for the hidden state is costly for\r\nplatforms like Electron.\r\n\r\nCloses #14066","created_at":"Feb 17, 2016 11:16:25 AM","updated_at":"Feb 21, 2016 9:44:58 AM","merge_commit_sha":"84df25366d620e8bfc7f5551d33f64586164dd0a","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/statuses/3b4cddad751b7e1e9395ac63c24c5099bf19449a","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"unstable","comments":5,"review_comments":5,"commits":1,"additions":34,"deletions":21,"changed_files":6,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071/comments"}}},"user":{"id":1153097,"login":"Narretz","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narretz"}},{"id":59663844,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14070","state":"open","number":14070,"locked":false,"title":"fix($compile): handle boolean attributes in `@` bindings","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14070","id":59663844,"html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070","diff_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14070","number":14070,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"fix($compile): handle boolean attributes in `@` bindings","user":{"id":232606,"login":"jannic","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jannic"},"body":"Commit db5e0ff handles initial values of boolean attributes.

does not follow any type restriction. Any $observe on the value attribute will therefore receive\r\nthe original value (result of ngValue expression). However, when a user selects an option, the browser\r\nsets the select value to the actual option\u0027s value attribute, which is still always a string.\r\nFor that reason, when option are added by ngValue, we set the hashed value of the original value in\r\nthe value attribute and store the actual value in an extra map.

Ex:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027myToggle.toggle();\u0027\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\r\n\u003cp ng-show\u003d\u0027myToggle.isOpened()\u0027\u003eThe toggle is active\u003c/p\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nso it can be accessed from enclosing components. \r\nUntil this point, it is a kind of custom `controllerAs` property for parent scope.\r\n\r\n### Using with parent components\r\nIn addition, as following the recommendation did by @petebacondarwin in https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/10007#issuecomment-168425866 it is able to assign it to any value, event enclosing controller. Ex:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027$ctrl.myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Keep track of DOM elements\r\nIt also serves to look for exact DOM elements instead of relaying in _jqLite_ searches. In case that there is no a controller, the as directive assigns the current DOM element to the expression set.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cbr\u003eFrom \u003ca href\u003d\u0027https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio\u0027\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\t\u003cplayer\u003e\u003c/player\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027player\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\ttemplate: \u0027\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u003caudio as\u003d\u0027$ctrl.audio\u0027 src\u003d\u0027http://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/2926/\u003dAudioTest_(1).ogg\u0027\u003e\u003c/audio\u003e\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027$ctrl.play()\u0027\u003ePlay\u003c/button\u003e\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u0027,\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.play \u003d function() {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.audio.play();\r\n\t\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### _Deprecating_ ngController\r\nngController is great for SEO webpages, but it has the inconvenience that it does not integrates well with bindings and many things have to be done \u0027manually\u0027.

You can imagine more complex functionalities, but I think that this is just enough to expose.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine that we do a directive to handle the same behaviour:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-detail book-id\u003d\u00272\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-detail\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).directive(\u0027staticBookDetail\u0027, function() {\r\n\t\t\treturn {\r\n\t\t\t\tscope: true,\r\n\t\t\t\tcontroller: function(booksService) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\tcontrollerAs: \u0027bookDetailCtrl\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t\tbindToController: {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbookId: \u0027@\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook($attrs.bookId);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt has a conceptual problem: you must know by heart that static-book-detail publishes the `bookDetailCtrl`. \r\n\r\nAlternatively you can use a component, which always use `$ctrl` like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cp\u003eDoes not works as expected:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-component book-id\u003d\u00273\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{$ctrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{$ctrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-component\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027staticBookComponent\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function(booksService) {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tbindings: {\r\n\t\t\t\tbookId: \u0027@\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this naive solution does not works because `$ctrl` is not defined in the same scope that code relies.\r\n\r\nFinally, using as you can have this solution that seems cleaner and more easy to understand:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cp\u003eIt dows works (and no implicit):\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-component as\u003d\u0027$ctrl\u0027 book-id\u003d\u00274\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{$ctrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{$ctrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-component\u003e\r\n\r\n\t\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n\t\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027myToggle.toggle();\u0027\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\r\n\t\u003cp ng-show\u003d\u0027myToggle.isOpened()\u0027\u003eThe toggle is active\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027toggle\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tvar opened \u003d false;\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.isOpened \u003d function() {Â return opened; };\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.toggle \u003d function() { opened \u003d !opened; };\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Additional Notes_: `as` directive behaviour is very close to **Angular2** `#` template variables. It also copies concepts from _RiotJS_ and _Polymer_ (at least first versions).\r\n","created_at":"Feb 18, 2016 9:57:16 AM","updated_at":"Feb 19, 2016 2:19:17 PM","merge_commit_sha":"45aac1aaee1a94151d6c735b6001933bd751ba49","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/statuses/e8bf84649abde311f00964753ed44bb9cb0058a3","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"clean","comments":4,"review_comments":17,"commits":4,"additions":161,"deletions":0,"changed_files":4,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14080"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14080"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14080/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080/comments"}}},"user":{"id":2758345,"login":"drpicox","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drpicox"}},{"id":59693678,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071","state":"open","number":14071,"locked":false,"title":"perf($animate): listen for document visibility changes","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071","id":59693678,"html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071","diff_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071","number":14071,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"perf($animate): listen for document visibility changes","user":{"id":1153097,"login":"Narretz","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narretz"},"body":"Accessing the document for the hidden state is costly for\r\nplatforms like Electron.\r\n\r\nCloses #14066","created_at":"Feb 17, 2016 11:16:25 AM","updated_at":"Feb 21, 2016 9:44:58 AM","merge_commit_sha":"84df25366d620e8bfc7f5551d33f64586164dd0a","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/statuses/3b4cddad751b7e1e9395ac63c24c5099bf19449a","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"unstable","comments":5,"review_comments":5,"commits":1,"additions":34,"deletions":21,"changed_files":6,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071/comments"}}},"user":{"id":1153097,"login":"Narretz","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narretz"}},{"id":59663844,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14070","state":"open","number":14070,"locked":false,"title":"fix($compile): handle boolean attributes in `@` bindings","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14070","id":59663844,"html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070","diff_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14070","number":14070,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"fix($compile): handle boolean attributes in `@` bindings","user":{"id":232606,"login":"jannic","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jannic"},"body":"Commit db5e0ff handles initial values of boolean attributes.

does not follow any type restriction. Any $observe on the value attribute will therefore receive\r\nthe original value (result of ngValue expression). However, when a user selects an option, the browser\r\nsets the select value to the actual option\u0027s value attribute, which is still always a string.\r\nFor that reason, when option are added by ngValue, we set the hashed value of the original value in\r\nthe value attribute and store the actual value in an extra map.

Ex:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027myToggle.toggle();\u0027\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\r\n\u003cp ng-show\u003d\u0027myToggle.isOpened()\u0027\u003eThe toggle is active\u003c/p\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nso it can be accessed from enclosing components. \r\nUntil this point, it is a kind of custom `controllerAs` property for parent scope.\r\n\r\n### Using with parent components\r\nIn addition, as following the recommendation did by @petebacondarwin in https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/10007#issuecomment-168425866 it is able to assign it to any value, event enclosing controller. Ex:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027$ctrl.myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Keep track of DOM elements\r\nIt also serves to look for exact DOM elements instead of relaying in _jqLite_ searches. In case that there is no a controller, the as directive assigns the current DOM element to the expression set.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cbr\u003eFrom \u003ca href\u003d\u0027https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio\u0027\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\t\u003cplayer\u003e\u003c/player\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027player\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\ttemplate: \u0027\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u003caudio as\u003d\u0027$ctrl.audio\u0027 src\u003d\u0027http://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/2926/\u003dAudioTest_(1).ogg\u0027\u003e\u003c/audio\u003e\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027$ctrl.play()\u0027\u003ePlay\u003c/button\u003e\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u0027,\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.play \u003d function() {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.audio.play();\r\n\t\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### _Deprecating_ ngController\r\nngController is great for SEO webpages, but it has the inconvenience that it does not integrates well with bindings and many things have to be done \u0027manually\u0027.

You can imagine more complex functionalities, but I think that this is just enough to expose.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine that we do a directive to handle the same behaviour:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-detail book-id\u003d\u00272\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-detail\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).directive(\u0027staticBookDetail\u0027, function() {\r\n\t\t\treturn {\r\n\t\t\t\tscope: true,\r\n\t\t\t\tcontroller: function(booksService) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\tcontrollerAs: \u0027bookDetailCtrl\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t\tbindToController: {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbookId: \u0027@\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook($attrs.bookId);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt has a conceptual problem: you must know by heart that static-book-detail publishes the `bookDetailCtrl`. \r\n\r\nAlternatively you can use a component, which always use `$ctrl` like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cp\u003eDoes not works as expected:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-component book-id\u003d\u00273\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{$ctrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{$ctrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-component\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027staticBookComponent\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function(booksService) {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tbindings: {\r\n\t\t\t\tbookId: \u0027@\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this naive solution does not works because `$ctrl` is not defined in the same scope that code relies.\r\n\r\nFinally, using as you can have this solution that seems cleaner and more easy to understand:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cp\u003eIt dows works (and no implicit):\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-component as\u003d\u0027$ctrl\u0027 book-id\u003d\u00274\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{$ctrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{$ctrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-component\u003e\r\n\r\n\t\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n\t\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027myToggle.toggle();\u0027\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\r\n\t\u003cp ng-show\u003d\u0027myToggle.isOpened()\u0027\u003eThe toggle is active\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027toggle\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tvar opened \u003d false;\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.isOpened \u003d function() {Â return opened; };\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.toggle \u003d function() { opened \u003d !opened; };\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Additional Notes_: `as` directive behaviour is very close to **Angular2** `#` template variables. It also copies concepts from _RiotJS_ and _Polymer_ (at least first versions).\r\n","created_at":"Feb 18, 2016 9:57:16 AM","updated_at":"Feb 19, 2016 2:19:17 PM","merge_commit_sha":"45aac1aaee1a94151d6c735b6001933bd751ba49","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/statuses/e8bf84649abde311f00964753ed44bb9cb0058a3","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"clean","comments":4,"review_comments":17,"commits":4,"additions":161,"deletions":0,"changed_files":4,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14080"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14080"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14080/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080/comments"}}},"user":{"id":2758345,"login":"drpicox","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drpicox"}},{"id":59693678,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071","state":"open","number":14071,"locked":false,"title":"perf($animate): listen for document visibility changes","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071","id":59693678,"html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071","diff_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071","number":14071,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"perf($animate): listen for document visibility changes","user":{"id":1153097,"login":"Narretz","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narretz"},"body":"Accessing the document for the hidden state is costly for\r\nplatforms like Electron.\r\n\r\nCloses #14066","created_at":"Feb 17, 2016 11:16:25 AM","updated_at":"Feb 21, 2016 9:44:58 AM","merge_commit_sha":"84df25366d620e8bfc7f5551d33f64586164dd0a","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/statuses/3b4cddad751b7e1e9395ac63c24c5099bf19449a","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"unstable","comments":5,"review_comments":5,"commits":1,"additions":34,"deletions":21,"changed_files":6,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071/comments"}}},"user":{"id":1153097,"login":"Narretz","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narretz"}},{"id":59663844,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14070","state":"open","number":14070,"locked":false,"title":"fix($compile): handle boolean attributes in `@` bindings","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14070","id":59663844,"html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070","diff_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14070","number":14070,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"fix($compile): handle boolean attributes in `@` bindings","user":{"id":232606,"login":"jannic","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jannic"},"body":"Commit db5e0ff handles initial values of boolean attributes.

Ex:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027myToggle.toggle();\u0027\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\r\n\u003cp ng-show\u003d\u0027myToggle.isOpened()\u0027\u003eThe toggle is active\u003c/p\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nso it can be accessed from enclosing components. \r\nUntil this point, it is a kind of custom `controllerAs` property for parent scope.\r\n\r\n### Using with parent components\r\nIn addition, as following the recommendation did by @petebacondarwin in https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/10007#issuecomment-168425866 it is able to assign it to any value, event enclosing controller. Ex:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027$ctrl.myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Keep track of DOM elements\r\nIt also serves to look for exact DOM elements instead of relaying in _jqLite_ searches. In case that there is no a controller, the as directive assigns the current DOM element to the expression set.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cbr\u003eFrom \u003ca href\u003d\u0027https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio\u0027\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\t\u003cplayer\u003e\u003c/player\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027player\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\ttemplate: \u0027\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u003caudio as\u003d\u0027$ctrl.audio\u0027 src\u003d\u0027http://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/2926/\u003dAudioTest_(1).ogg\u0027\u003e\u003c/audio\u003e\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027$ctrl.play()\u0027\u003ePlay\u003c/button\u003e\u0027 +\r\n\t\t\t\t\u0027\u0027,\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.play \u003d function() {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.audio.play();\r\n\t\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### _Deprecating_ ngController\r\nngController is great for SEO webpages, but it has the inconvenience that it does not integrates well with bindings and many things have to be done \u0027manually\u0027. For example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular\r\n\t\t\t.module(\u0027demo\u0027, [])\r\n\t\t\t.service(\u0027booksService\u0027, function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.getBook \u003d function(id) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\treturn { name: \u0027name\u0027+id, abstract: \u0027abstract...\u0027+id };\r\n\t\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\r\n\t\u003cdiv ng-controller\u003d\u0027BookDetailController as bookDetailCtrl\u0027 book-id\u003d\u00271\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).controller(\u0027BookDetailController\u0027, function(booksService,$attrs) {\r\n\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook($attrs.bookId);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example it needs to access to `$attrs` manually to find the bookId. You can imagine more complex functionalities, but I think that this is just enough to expose.\r\n\r\nNow, imagine that we do a directive to handle the same behaviour:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-detail book-id\u003d\u00272\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{bookDetailCtrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-detail\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).directive(\u0027staticBookDetail\u0027, function() {\r\n\t\t\treturn {\r\n\t\t\t\tscope: true,\r\n\t\t\t\tcontroller: function(booksService) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\tcontrollerAs: \u0027bookDetailCtrl\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t\tbindToController: {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbookId: \u0027@\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t};\r\n\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook($attrs.bookId);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt has a conceptual problem: you must know by heart that static-book-detail publishes the `bookDetailCtrl`. \r\n\r\nAlternatively you can use a component, which always use `$ctrl` like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cp\u003eDoes not works as expected:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-component book-id\u003d\u00273\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{$ctrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{$ctrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-component\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027staticBookComponent\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function(booksService) {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.book \u003d booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tbindings: {\r\n\t\t\t\tbookId: \u0027@\u0027,\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this naive solution does not works because `$ctrl` is not defined in the same scope that code relies.\r\n\r\nFinally, using as you can have this solution that seems cleaner and more easy to understand:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\u003cp\u003eIt dows works (and no implicit):\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cstatic-book-component as\u003d\u0027$ctrl\u0027 book-id\u003d\u00274\u0027\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ch1\u003e{{$ctrl.book.name}}\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e{{$ctrl.book.abstract}}\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003c/static-book-component\u003e\r\n\r\n\t\u003ctoggle as\u003d\u0027myToggle\u0027\u003e\u003c/toggle\u003e\r\n\t\u003cbutton ng-click\u003d\u0027myToggle.toggle();\u0027\u003eToggle\u003c/button\u003e\r\n\t\u003cp ng-show\u003d\u0027myToggle.isOpened()\u0027\u003eThe toggle is active\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\t\tangular.module(\u0027demo\u0027).component(\u0027toggle\u0027, {\r\n\t\t\tcontroller: function() {\r\n\t\t\t\tvar opened \u003d false;\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.isOpened \u003d function() {Â return opened; };\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.toggle \u003d function() { opened \u003d !opened; };\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Additional Notes_: `as` directive behaviour is very close to **Angular2** `#` template variables. It also copies concepts from _RiotJS_ and _Polymer_ (at least first versions).\r\n","created_at":"Feb 18, 2016 9:57:16 AM","updated_at":"Feb 19, 2016 2:19:17 PM","merge_commit_sha":"45aac1aaee1a94151d6c735b6001933bd751ba49","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/statuses/e8bf84649abde311f00964753ed44bb9cb0058a3","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"clean","comments":4,"review_comments":17,"commits":4,"additions":161,"deletions":0,"changed_files":4,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14080"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14080"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14080/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14080/comments"}}},"user":{"id":2758345,"login":"drpicox","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drpicox"}},{"id":59693678,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071","state":"open","number":14071,"locked":false,"title":"perf($animate): listen for document visibility changes","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071","id":59693678,"html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071","diff_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071","number":14071,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"perf($animate): listen for document visibility changes","user":{"id":1153097,"login":"Narretz","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narretz"},"body":"Accessing the document for the hidden state is costly for\r\nplatforms like Electron.\r\n\r\nCloses #14066","created_at":"Feb 17, 2016 11:16:25 AM","updated_at":"Feb 21, 2016 9:44:58 AM","merge_commit_sha":"84df25366d620e8bfc7f5551d33f64586164dd0a","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071/commits","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/statuses/3b4cddad751b7e1e9395ac63c24c5099bf19449a","merged":false,"mergeable":true,"mergeable_state":"unstable","comments":5,"review_comments":5,"commits":1,"additions":34,"deletions":21,"changed_files":6,"_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14071"},"issue":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14071/comments"},"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14071/comments"}}},"user":{"id":1153097,"login":"Narretz","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Narretz"}},{"id":59663844,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14070","state":"open","number":14070,"locked":false,"title":"fix($compile): handle boolean attributes in `@` bindings","pullData":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/pulls/14070","id":59663844,"html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070","diff_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14070.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular.js/issues/14070","number":14070,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"fix($compile): handle boolean attributes in `@` bindings","user":{"id":232606,"login":"jannic","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jannic"},"body":"Commit db5e0ff handles initial values of boolean attributes.

https://github.com/angular/material/commit/9a36112c2a2604dbfd2100deb2daa661a773ef06 I got problems with scrolling in a virtual-repeat container.\r\n\r\nWhen you use the mousewheel to scroll down the virtual-repeat container, you can scroll lower than possible. The patch https://github.com/angular/material/commit/9a36112c2a2604dbfd2100deb2daa661a773ef06 catches the case that the user scroll lower than bottom and exit the function.\r\n\r\nWith my patch the behaviour is that when the user scrolls lower than the bottom, than the container do scroll to the end of the container.","created_at":"Feb 18, 2016 12:53:49 AM","updated_at":"Feb 26, 2016 4:33:32
